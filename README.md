EduEye
===========

EduEye-project is based on andriod-eye-project https://github.com/Teaonly/android-eye

Change your mobile phone into a document camera.
1. Install mobile client
2. Download desktop client
3. Scan the QR-code with mobile client to start streaming Mobile device's camera picture to desktop client. 

## Use cases ##
* Teachers can share pictures of text books etc. to pupils via video projector
* Pupils can share the stage of their group work with rest of the class using EduEye without moving from their desks and interrupting the workflow
* I've used EduEye on a Lego Mindstorms robot to create a "Mars rover"

## TODO: ##
* Publish EduEye client for desktop
* Publish EduEye in Play Store
